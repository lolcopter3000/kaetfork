			Before 2027 I will live in the UK.  <br />
			Widely interested and keen to learn. Here is a list of books I have read this year. <br />
			Why counterpoint? I love the breadth of stuff you learn through odd process. I audit drama dept modules and they think i'm stupid. <br />
			Samuel Beckett said, the duty of an artist is to fail, as no other dare fail, that failure is his world.  <br />
			Sources which have influenced me as of late: Stop Making Sense, Blindboy Boatclub, the Fish, friends, Adrianne Lenker, land sculpture, plants  <br />
